	     BTYACC -- backtracking yacc
	     ===========================

BTYACC was created by Chris Dodd using ideas from many
places and lots of code from the Berkeley Yacc
distribution, which is a public domain yacc clone put
together by the good folks at Berkeley.  This code is
distributed with NO WARRANTEE and is public domain. 
It is certain to contain bugs, which you should 
report to: cdodd@acm.org

Vadim Maslov of Siber Systems <vadik@siber.com> 
considerably modified BTYACC to make it suitable 
for production environment.

Several people have suggested bug fixes that 
were incorporated into BtYacc.

See the README.BYACC files for more about 
Berkeley Yacc and other sources of info.

btyacc is backwards compatible with the POSIX yacc specification in
IEEE 1003.2.  A copy of the relevant specification may be available at
ftp://ftp.fi.netbsd.org/ftp/pub/doc/posix/p1003.2/d11.2/a.3
