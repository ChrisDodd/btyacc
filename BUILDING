Hopefully, on any POSIX machine you should be able to just type `make'
and everything should work.  If you don't have nawk and can't get it
(or something equivalent, like gawk), there's an awk version of skel2c.

For MSDOS, there a `makefile.dos' that should do the trick

The result of this should be a single executable called `btyacc' which
you can install anywhere you like; it does not require any other files
in the distribution to run.
